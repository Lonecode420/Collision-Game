# Collision-Game
Canvas-based survival game built in pure JavaScript featuring collision detection, physics-driven enemies, dynamic difficulty scaling, and real-time rendering using requestAnimationFrame.
The (game.html) file has been updated and it is more dynamic with many more effects like shoooting with the screen shaking and the enemy counter.
